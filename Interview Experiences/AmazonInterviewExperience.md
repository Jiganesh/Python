#### MY FIRST FAANGM Experience (Serious Attempt.....Not Really ðŸ˜†)
 
##### ROUND 1: ( ONLINE ASSESSMENT)

Platform : I dont remember exactly but It was probably HackerRank

2 Questions and Loads of Behavioural Question (Duration: 1hr 10 min)

- Question 1 : 
(Total Time Taken = 20 minutes)
The Question was on Medium Level. Variation of Prefix Sum. Recognizing the question is from Prefix Sum was hard for me but after recognizing I completed the code instantly.
Time Complexity of Solution : O(N)
Space Complexity of Solution : O(N)
I couldhv done at O(1) but it was 1.00 at night and I am just lazy so I used itertools module

- Question 2:
(Total Time Taken = 10 minutes)
This Question was on Medium Level. Situational Problem, Somewhat based on sorting but I used BucketSort Technique which is comparison less sorting and it got accepted so didnt try to optimize it.
Time Complexity of Solution : O(N) (avg for bucketSort) O(N^2) (worst for bucketSort)
Space Complexity of Solution : Made array of 2* (10**5) ðŸ˜Ž If Solution was not accepted I wouldhv optimized it, but got accepted so didn't change anything (IF IT WORKS DONT CHANGE)

- Behavourial Questions
Lots of Questions, Gave most relatable answer, Usually I just tick tick tick for Questions like this but I just felt like reading what are those so did it seriously.


##### Verdict Round 1: PASSED ðŸŽ‰


##### ROUND 2 : (Technical DSA Interview) ðŸ˜ž

Interviewer was SDE2 with 2 Year Exp (5 minutes Late)

- Standard Introductions

- Warmup  : Find the Number is even or not asked Time Complexity and Space Complexity : O(1), O(1)
- Warmup  : Find the Number is even or not in recursive way asked Time Complexity and Space Complexity : O(N), O(N)


- Question 1 ("Solved With Help") (30 minutes)
    Discussion on Binary Tree and Types of Traversal 
    Standard **** Order Iterative Traversal for Binary Search Tree (Didn't study realized I'hv forgot all my basics with help of Interviewer solved this question) ```DUMB ME MOMENTS```


- Question 2 ("Just BruteForced")
    Custom Question
    (Optimal solution which I was not able to do : ) - I dont know what that algorithm is called which is used for optimal solution. I call it sweep algorithm
    Similar Leetcode Questions : Candy (Hard), Product Except Self (Medium)

No Behavioural Questions Asked

- Any Questions

##### Verdict Round 2 : Lean Hire / Lean Not Hire

```
Lessons Learned:

Didnt prepare Introduction (My Introduction went very rough)
Always Revise your basics, Foundation is very important.
Time Awareness : Always Remember you need to solve two DSA Question,
In around 40 minutes which is hard enough. 
Do not hesitate to ask question please ask whatever you want to know to help you solve problem

First Thing I did that day - corrected this Mistakes I made / Perfected Graphs and Trees
```

##### ROUND 3 (Technical DSA Interview and Behavioural Interview) ðŸ˜„

Interviewer's SDE2 and SDE1 2 Year Exp (Both before Time)

- Standard Introductions (This time gave fluence Introductions)
- Some Industry Experience and Coorporate Behavourial Questions

- Question 1 ("Solved Optimally with Help") (25 Minutes)
    
    Variation of Spaced Binary Search (Medium Level Question)
    TC: BruteForced O(NK)
    SC: O(1)

    TC : Optimal O(NlogK)
    SC : O(1)

- Question 2 ("Presented Optimal Solution, Optimized more with help")

    Variation of Next Greater Element (Medium Level Question) (15 Minutes)
    TC : BruteForced O(N^2)
    SC : O(1)

    TC : Optimal Solution O(N)
    SC : O(N)

- Any Questions


##### Verdict Round 3 : Lean Hire / Hire

##### ROUND 4 
(Technical DSA Interview and Behavioural Interview) ðŸ“… I rescheduled it.

##### ROUND 4 
(Technical DSA Interview and Behavioural Interview) ðŸ™‹

Interviewer : Software Developement Manager 7 Years of Experience (15 Minutes late)

- Standard Introductions (Gave Smooth Introduction)
- Lots of Industry Experience and Coorporate Behavourial Questions

- Questions 1 ("Solved Optimally  without much Help but did healthy discussion and explained why my code works")
    - Custom Question and Variation of Next Smaller Element + Math 
    - Medium Level Question
    TC : BruteForced O(N^2)
    SC : O(1)
    TC : Optimal O(N)
    SC : O(N)

- Questions 2 ("Solved Optimally after Explaining 4 separate solutions") 
    - I am not sure about solution I wrote at last, ðŸ‘½ RIP ME
    - Probably custom Question Based on Linked List and Math 
    - Didnt study Linked List in my entire Interview process ðŸ¥²
    - I actually started writing function, I should'hv gone with OOP approach : creating node class to get extra points.
    - Medium Level Question
    TC : BruteForced O(N)
    SC : O(1)
    TC : Optimal O(N)
    SC : Optimal (1)

- Any Questions


##### Verdict Round 4 : HIRED

##### Things I could have done better:
- I treated this Interview as a Mock Interview. 
- It takes a lot of knowledge to crack DSA Questions. So I didn't study before any Interview. 
- I study DSA everyday so there is a quote :

```
If you study everyday, not studying for one day wont matter &
If you have not studied everyday, studying for one day wont matter
```

- I checked that I was using college Resume in which I didnt had any of recent acheivements and experience. Please do remember to update your Resume
